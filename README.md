# Simple Local Server test using Deno v1.0

[Deno](https://deno.land/) is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.
This repository is created to showcase how to create a simple local server using Deno.

## Installation

Using Shell (macOS, Linux):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

## Development

Run the following command:

```sh
deno run --allow-net index.ts
```

## Nice to know

You run `deno fmt index.ts` to automatically format the file properly.
